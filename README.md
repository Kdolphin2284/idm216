# IDM216 - User Experience Design II
Github repository for the development of the Happy Sunshine food truck app by Team Relic.

## Editor
- Visual Studio Code
- Within editor, indent each subsequent line of code with one more tab than the line above, unless you are closing a block of code, or if the code you are writing should be in line with the code above
```
Example:

<div id="exampleDiv">
    <h1>Like this</h1>
    <h3>And this</h3>
</div>
```
- Notice how in the above example, the h1 and h3 are both indented with one tab, since they are inside of the div. The h3 and h1 are not children of one another, so they sit in line with each other. The last div tag sits one tab back from the h1 and h3, as well as in line with the cooresponding div tag. This is because it closes that "block" of code.
- Camel case is used for classes and ids. An example of this would be "teamRelic"
