                    <h2>The Overview</h2>
                        <p>The objective for this project was to develop a dynamic, functional food ordering website - optimized for all screen sizes. 
                            We were given an original design for this food ordering website, and allowed to tweak it if we chose to do so. Once we were set on the 
                            design, we developed the mobile version first - followed by the tablet and desktop versions in the weeks leading up to the finalized project. 
                            The project was successful since we were able to develop a dynamic, functional food ordering website.

                        <p>I worked closely in a group of 5 total people, as the lead developer, in order to develop a dynamic, functional food ordering website. 
                            Over a span of 10 weeks, I developed this website by first starting at the mobile breakpoint, followed by the respective tablet and desktop breakpoints. 
                            We were given full designs for the website, and applied minor changes to them, since our lead designer had designed them a few months prior.

                            who often orders food.

                                <h4>Alpha</h4>
                                <p>The project started off with looking at designs and determining whether they should be changed or not. I did not partake in this, 
                                    since I am the lead developer and I trusted our lead designer to make the right decisions. Once this was set, they were handed off 
                                    to me so I could produce the alpha of the project. The alpha consisted of only a mobile breakpoint, and minimal to no microinteractions. 
                                    Our beta consisted of all of our main screens, minus the login screen, and I also developed a functional hamburger menu.
                                </p>

                            </div>

                                <h4>Beta</h4>
                                <p>Once the alpha was developed, our project manager, data architect, secondary coder, and our lead designer went and did user testing, and brought 
                                    back feedback in order to improve the overall experience. We didn't get much negative feedback at all, so very little changes were made to the product. 
                                    I started developing the beta, which consisted of a tablet breakpoint, as well as some microinteractions and at least one example of database retrieval. 
                                    The links to the different ordering pages are all dynamic, meaning the information on the linked page will be different depending on what link is clicked.
                                </p>
                                <a href="../../beta/index.php" target="_blank">Link to the beta</a>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-1-1">
                                <h4>Final</h4>
                                <p>Once the beta was developed, the team did another round of user testing, and we made tweaks to the website accordingly. I then started developing the final. 
                                    The final consisted of a desktop breakpoint, so the website would look on all screensizes, as well as full databse and javascript integration. Starting on the 
                                    homepage, I developed a "widget" (I like to call it that) that consists of an image of a cart icon, as well as a number that appears when something has been added 
                                    to the cart. This number increases or decreases on every page, and will always take you to the cart - which is updated with information relative to what you have in your cart. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Going through the order flow, users will find that the price of an item changes depending on if it's toppings cost money. This is reflected in the cart, and if a user has 
                                    multiple items in their cart, a "grand total" is shown at the bottom of the cart, which is the sum of money that all items cost. The receipt and order summary pages reflect 
                                    the order information, which was done with multiple tables, and copying information from one table to another. The order tracking page is a functional, sped-up representation 
                                    of how it would look to be tracking your order, and was created using timed javascript functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>After a user has completed the full order flow, they are taken back to the home page. From there they can access the recent orders page and view their recently ordered food. They can 
                                    click on the heart icon to add a previous order to their favorie orders page, which dynamically updates depending on what users favorite. The heart on the recent orders page becomes filled 
                                    in, to signify that that order has been favorited - this is reflected on the favorite orders page, where all hearts are filled in.
                                </p>
